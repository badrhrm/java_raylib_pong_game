# java_raylib_pong_game
Unfortunately the java bindings for raylib has some issues; thus, this ends here though it would have been nice to add a main menu and multiplayer to learn network programming especially with java.

This was built using [Raylib-J](https://github.com/CreedVI/Raylib-J) (java bindings for raylib) which requires [LWJGL3](https://www.lwjgl.org/).
